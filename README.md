# Droidspaces RootFS Automated Build

This project builds Linux RootFS archives for Droidspaces through GitHub Actions. The build system is based on Dockerfile templates and exposes common options for distribution selection, KDE desktop size, Chinese localization, input method support, Snapdragon GPU acceleration, audio forwarding, TMOE, Docker, development tools, and Wayland/Anland support.

The goal is to reduce the amount of manual setup required to run a desktop Linux container on Android. Fork the repository, choose the build options in GitHub Actions, wait for the Release artifact, then import the generated `.tar.xz` RootFS into Droidspaces.

`all` builds every Dockerfile template. `all-wayland` builds only the Wayland-capable targets, currently `Debian-13-KDE`, `Ubuntu-26-KDE`, `Fedora-43-KDE`, and `Fedora-44-KDE`, and forces Wayland support on.

## Feature Overview

- Multi-distribution RootFS builds for Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, and Arch.
- Scalable KDE desktop profiles, from command-line only to minimal, compact, and mobile KDE.
- Desktop auto-start and failure recovery using shared systemd service templates for X11, Plasma Wayland, and Plasma Mobile, with rate-limited automatic restarts after failures.
- Termux:X11 desktop startup support. X11 mode defaults to `DISPLAY=:5`.
- PulseAudio forwarding through Unix socket, TCP, or disabled mode.
- Optional Chinese locale with `zh_CN.UTF-8` and `Asia/Shanghai` timezone.
- Optional Fcitx5 input method. Chinese input addons are installed when Chinese localization is enabled.
- Snapdragon GPU support using configuration from `mesa-for-android-container`.
- Optional Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 Wayland display-corruption fix through a Turnip UBWC environment setting.
- Container integration improvements for common Android/Droidspaces hardware, network, and group recognition.
- Optional TMOE integration. Run `tmoe` inside the container to start it.
- Optional development toolchain packages, including compilers, CMake, and Python development tooling.
- Optional compression utilities such as `zip`, `unzip`, `7z`, `xz`, `tar`, and `gzip`.
- Optional Docker packages inside the RootFS.
- Optional old-kernel systemd compatibility: on apt, dnf, or pacman targets whose systemd major version is above 257, build and install `v257-stable`; Debian 13 and other 257-or-older systems are skipped automatically.
- Stable Wayland/Anland support for Debian 13, Ubuntu 26.04, Fedora 43, and Fedora 44 through patched KWin and Xwayland packages.
- USB device management on every distribution through Droidspaces USB Manager, including USB storage, ADB device nodes, mounting, unmounting, and a system tray interface.
- Automatic Release publishing with the RootFS `.tar.xz` files and matching audio startup scripts.

## Build Options

The main GitHub Actions inputs are:

| Option | Values | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Distribution to build (`build_target`) | Distribution target, `all`, `all-wayland` | `Debian-13-KDE` | Selects which RootFS target to build. |
| Custom username (`custom_username`) | String | `Gold` | Default user inside the RootFS. The audio startup script in the Release is patched with this username. |
| KDE desktop choice (`build_KDE`) | `conc`, `min`, `mobile`, `none` | `min` | KDE desktop size. `none` builds a command-line only RootFS. |
| KDE desktop auto-start (`build_KDE_plus`) | `true`, `false` | `true` | Creates a systemd service to auto-start KDE. Requires a KDE mode other than `none`; turn it off when building `none`. |
| Wayland support (`enable_anland_kde`) | `true`, `false` | `false` | Enables Wayland/Anland support on Debian 13, Ubuntu 26, Fedora 43, and Fedora 44. |
| PulseAudio forwarding (`PulseAudio`) | `socket`, `tcp`, `none` | `socket` | Audio forwarding mode for X11 builds. It is forced to `none` when Anland is enabled. |
| Chinese language and timezone (`enable_zh_tz`) | `true`, `false` | `false` in the English workflow | Enables Chinese locale and the Shanghai timezone. |
| Qualcomm Snapdragon GPU support (`enable_mesa`) | `true`, `false` | `true` | Enables Qualcomm Snapdragon GPU and Mesa-related support. |
| Fix Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 Wayland display corruption (`enable_8gen2_wayland`) | `true`, `false` | `false` | Writes `FD_DEV_FEATURES=enable_tp_ubwc_flag_hint=1` to `/etc/environment` for Debian 13, Ubuntu 26, and Fedora 43/44. |
| Integrate TMOE (`enable_tmoe`) | `true`, `false` | `true` | Integrates TMOE. |
| Remove Ubuntu Snap (`nosnap`) | `true`, `false` | `false` | Ubuntu-only option that removes Snap, snapd, and APT policy paths that may reinstall snapd. |
| systemd 257 old-kernel compatibility (`enable_systemd257`) | `true`, `false` | `false` | When enabled, builds a `v257-stable` compatibility runtime if the current systemd major version is above 257; versions 257 and older are skipped. systemd-related packages are locked after the build to prevent replacement by upgrades. |
| Fcitx5 input method support (`enable_srf`) | `true`, `false` | `false` | Installs Fcitx5 input method support. |
| Cross-architecture support (`enable_binfmt`) | `true`, `false` | `false` | Adds binfmt cross-architecture components inside the RootFS. Not recommended for Arch in this project. |
| NAT and hardware recognition (`enable_yj`) | `true`, `false` | `true` | Enables container hardware and network recognition improvements. |
| Development tools integration (`enable_kfgj`) | `true`, `false` | `false` | Installs development tools. |
| Compression tools integration (`enable_zip`) | `true`, `false` | `true` | Installs common compression tools. |
| Docker integration (`enable_docker`) | `true`, `false` | `false` | Installs Docker-related packages inside the RootFS. |
| Build Wayland prebuilt packages (`build_wayland_packages`) | `true`, `false` | `false` | Triggers the KWin/Xwayland prebuilt package workflow before building the RootFS. |

KDE mode details:

| Mode | Description | Recommended use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `none` | Does not install KDE. Keeps a command-line environment only. | Lightweight RootFS, SSH use, development environments, or custom desktop setups. |
| `min` | Minimal KDE desktop with Plasma basics and startup dependencies. | Smaller KDE builds that still provide a usable desktop. |
| `conc` | Compact but more complete KDE desktop with more system tools, monitoring, file management, and multimedia components. | General desktop use. |
| `mobile` | KDE Plasma Mobile components. | Phone-screen and touch-first usage; forces Wayland in this project. |

Audio mode details:

| Mode | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `socket` | Uses a Unix socket for PulseAudio forwarding. This is usually lower latency and is recommended for X11 mode. |
| `tcp` | Uses `127.0.0.1:4713` for PulseAudio forwarding. It is straightforward to debug, but exposes a wider interface. |
| `none` | Does not configure PulseAudio. Anland mode automatically uses this value because the Anland app provides its own audio path. |

### systemd 257 old-kernel compatibility

When `enable_systemd257` is enabled, the build runs `scripts/systemd257.sh`. The script first detects the installed systemd major version:

- systemd 257 or older (for example Debian 13 and Ubuntu 24.04) is skipped;
- apt, dnf, and pacman systems above 257 build systemd 257 from the official `v257-stable` branch;
- build dependencies are removed after the build, and systemd-related packages are locked so a later upgrade does not overwrite the compatibility runtime.

This option targets old Android kernels and is experimental. It adds substantial build time; test the desktop, dbus, udev, and networking behavior on the target kernel before distributing the image.

## Build with GitHub Actions

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.
2. Open the `Actions` page in your fork.
3. Select the Chinese workflow `编译并发布 Droidspaces RootFS` or the English workflow `Build and Release Droidspaces RootFS`.
4. Click `Run workflow`.
5. Choose the distribution, KDE mode, username, and feature toggles.
6. For Wayland/Anland builds, choose `Ubuntu-26-KDE`, `Debian-13-KDE`, `Fedora-43-KDE`, or `Fedora-44-KDE`, then enable `enable_anland_kde`.
7. If you want to rebuild the patched KWin/Xwayland packages before building the RootFS, enable `build_wayland_packages`.
8. Wait for the workflow to finish. Build time depends on the number of targets, KDE mode, and GitHub runner availability.
9. Open the `Releases` page and download the generated `.tar.xz` RootFS.

The Release usually contains:

- One or more RootFS archives
- RootFS filenames are marked by display mode as `X11`, `Wayland`, or `Mobile`, for example `Ubuntu-26-KDE-Mobile-Droidspaces-rootfs-aarch64-v20260702-120000.tar.xz`.
- `on_aaudio_socket.sh` or `on_aaudio_tcp.sh` when `PulseAudio` is set to `socket` or `tcp` and `build_KDE_plus=false`.
- A Release body that records the build target, KDE mode, Wayland setting, username, and feature toggles.

## Import into Droidspaces

1. Create or import a container in Droidspaces.
2. Select the `.tar.xz` RootFS downloaded from the Release.
3. If the RootFS includes KDE, enable GPU access in Droidspaces.
4. For Ubuntu and Debian, enabling `noseccomp` in privileged mode is strongly recommended. The kernel should also have `USER_NS` enabled. Without these, some desktop operations may freeze or lag noticeably.
5. For Fedora, some devices require hardware access. Without it, the desktop may flicker or crash.
6. For Arch, kernel 5.10 or newer is recommended.
7. For X11 mode, prepare Termux:X11.
8. For Wayland/Anland mode, complete the host-side Anland setup described below.

## Start KDE Desktop

When `build_KDE_plus` is enabled, the build installs the systemd service matching the selected desktop mode:

| Desktop mode | Service file | Start command |
| --- | --- | --- |
| X11 | `plasma-x11.service` | `DISPLAY=:5 startplasma-x11` |
| Wayland | `plasma-wayland.service` | `startplasma-wayland` |
| Mobile | `plasma-mobile.service` | `startplasmamobile` |

These services run as UID 1000 and load `/etc/environment`. If the desktop process fails, systemd restarts it after 2 seconds. If it fails more than 5 times within 60 seconds, systemd temporarily stops retrying to prevent a crash loop. A normal exit does not trigger a restart.

### X11 Mode

X11 mode applies to builds where `enable_anland_kde` is disabled. The default display environment is:

```text
DISPLAY=:5
```

It is recommended to keep `build_KDE_plus=true`, which is now the default. With it enabled, the RootFS creates a KDE auto-start systemd service so the desktop can start after the container boots. Disable it only when you want to use the Termux-side `on_aaudio_*` script to start the desktop manually, or when building a `none` command-line environment.

If the Release includes an audio startup script, run it from Termux to start PulseAudio, Termux:X11, and KDE:

```bash
chmod +x on_aaudio_socket.sh
./on_aaudio_socket.sh
```

Or:

```bash
chmod +x on_aaudio_tcp.sh
./on_aaudio_tcp.sh
```

Before using the script, check the variables at the top:

```bash
CONTAINER_NAME="your Droidspaces container name"
USERNAME="your RootFS username"
DISPLAY_NUMBER=":5"
DPI=315
```

`USERNAME` is patched automatically during Release generation according to `custom_username`, but `CONTAINER_NAME` must still match the container name in Droidspaces.

If you do not use the helper script, enter the container and start KDE manually:

```bash
startplasma-x11
```

The actual auto-start behavior still depends on Droidspaces systemd support, permissions, and the configured display backend. If the desktop does not start automatically, enter the container and run `startplasma-x11` for debugging.

### Wayland/Anland Mode

Wayland/Anland mode applies to Debian 13, Ubuntu 26, Fedora 43, and Fedora 44 builds where `enable_anland_kde` is enabled. The default environment includes:

```text
WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-0
DISPLAY=:0
QT_QPA_PLATFORM=wayland
ANLAND=1
ANLAND_SOCKET=/run/display.sock
ANLAND_DRM_DEVICE=/dev/dri/renderD128
```

After completing the host-side Anland setup, run this inside the container:

```bash
startplasma-wayland
```

For a `mobile` build, the corresponding manual start command is:

```bash
startplasmamobile
```

## Wayland and Anland Setup

Wayland support depends on [anland](https://github.com/superturtlee/anland) and the patched KWin/Xwayland prebuilt packages stored in this repository. `Ubuntu-26-KDE` is recommended, while `Debian-13-KDE`, `Fedora-43-KDE`, and `Fedora-44-KDE` are also available. Fedora 44 now has stable Wayland/Anland support; it uses the Fedora 43 Anland build script but rebuilds the RPMs inside a Fedora 44 container.

### One-Click Installation of anland-build Packages

`anland-build/install.sh` automatically detects the current Linux distribution, installs the matching patched KWin/Xwayland packages, and prevents system updates from overwriting them. If the distribution repositories contain newer versions, the script allows the affected packages to be downgraded to the patched versions included in this repository. Packages that are already held can be updated and then placed on hold again.
The script reads the system language in `LC_ALL`, `LC_MESSAGES`, and `LANG` priority order. Chinese locales produce Chinese messages; all other locales produce English messages.

The installer supports Debian 13, Ubuntu 26.04, Fedora 43, and Fedora 44 on ARM64/aarch64 only. Debian and Ubuntu use `apt-mark hold`, while Fedora uses `exclude` entries in `/etc/dnf/dnf.conf` to provide equivalent package locking.

Run it from the repository root:

```bash
sudo ./anland-build/install.sh
```

Recommended build options:

| Option | Recommended value |
| --- | --- |
| `build_target` | `Ubuntu-26-KDE` |
| `build_KDE` | `min`, `conc`, or `mobile` |
| `build_KDE_plus` | `true` |
| `enable_anland_kde` | `true` |
| `PulseAudio` | No manual setting required; it becomes `none` when Anland is enabled |

Host-side setup:

1. Download `virtual-drm-daemon.zip` from [anland Releases](https://github.com/superturtlee/anland/releases), flash it, and reboot the device.
2. Download and install `app-debug.apk` from the same Release.
3. Enable hardware access when importing the Droidspaces container.
4. Enable SELinux permissive mode, or use the precise SELinux policy fix documented below.
5. Enable `nocaps` and `noseccomp` in privileged mode.
6. Add this bind mount in advanced options:

```text
/data/local/tmp/display_daemon.sock -> /run/display.sock
```

7. Start the container and log in as the normal user.
8. Run:

```bash
startplasma-wayland
```

If `mobile` is selected, the workflow forces Wayland on because Plasma Mobile is configured through the Wayland path in this project.

## Droidspaces USB Manager

All seven distribution templates install [Droidspaces-USB-Manager](https://github.com/Yizhou147/Droidspaces-USB-Manager) through `scripts/install-usb-manager.sh`. The installer detects Debian/Ubuntu, Fedora, or Arch, installs the matching PyQt5, ADB, udev, NTFS, and exFAT dependencies through APT, DNF, or Pacman, and fixes command paths that are Debian-specific in the upstream source.

Hardware access must be enabled when importing the RootFS into Droidspaces. Without it, `/sys/bus/usb` and `/sys/bus/scsi` devices are not visible inside the container. The installer creates both an application-menu entry and a `~/Desktop/usb-manager.desktop` desktop shortcut. After entering KDE, you can also run:

```bash
usb-manager
```

Two command-line entry points are also installed:

```bash
usb-passthrough
usb-storage-passthrough
```

To install or update the application separately on an existing system, run this from the repository root:

```bash
sudo ./scripts/install-usb-manager.sh --user "$USER"
```

Like `anland-build/install.sh`, this installer supports automatic privilege escalation, Chinese/English output, local-source preference, and an upstream source download fallback. If `--user` is omitted, it tries `SUDO_USER`, the logged-in user, and then the first regular user.

## Local Build

This project is designed primarily for GitHub Actions, but local Docker Buildx builds are supported. Requirements:

- Docker
- Docker Buildx
- `xz`
- A working QEMU/binfmt setup if cross-architecture builds are required

Native build example:

```bash
chmod +x build_rootfs-native.sh
./build_rootfs-native.sh \
  -i Debian-13-KDE.Dockerfile \
  -v local \
  -K min \
  -L true \
  -P socket \
  -g true \
  -a false \
  -b true \
  -c true \
  -d false \
  -e true \
  -f false \
  -h false \
  -j true \
  -n false \
  -S false \
  -t false \
  -u Gold \
  -A false
```

QEMU arm64 build example:

```bash
chmod +x build_rootfs-qemu-aarch64.sh
./build_rootfs-qemu-aarch64.sh \
  -i Ubuntu-26-KDE.Dockerfile \
  -v local \
  -K conc \
  -L true \
  -P none \
  -g true \
  -a false \
  -b true \
  -c true \
  -d false \
  -e true \
  -f false \
  -h true \
  -j true \
  -n true \
  -S false \
  -t false \
  -u Gold \
  -A true
```

After a successful build, the output file will look similar to:

```text
Ubuntu-26-KDE-Wayland-Droidspaces-rootfs-aarch64-local.tar.xz
```

## Install Hardware Firmware

Debian 13 and Ubuntu 24/25/26 RootFS images include `/usr/local/bin/download-firmware`. It installs `linux-firmware`, decompresses `.zst` firmware under `/lib/firmware` into regular firmware files, and repairs symbolic links that previously pointed to compressed files. This is useful when a kernel, driver, or container environment cannot load compressed firmware directly.

The tool is copied into the RootFS but is not run automatically during the build or container startup. Run it manually inside the container when needed:

```bash
sudo download-firmware
```

The script installs `zstd` and `linux-firmware`, so working package repositories and network access are required. On success it creates `/var/lib/.fw-setup-completed`. The current script does not use this marker to skip later runs; running it again still refreshes package metadata and scans the firmware directory.

`anland-build/` stores the patched KWin and Xwayland prebuilt packages together with the one-click installer. `build-kde-wayland.yml` can rebuild those packages and commit the updates back to the repository. The current Chinese RootFS workflow filename contains a leading space: `.github/workflows/ build-rootfs-releases.yml`.

## Known Limitations

- Wayland/Anland support currently covers only Debian 13, Ubuntu 26, and Fedora 43/44.
- Ubuntu 24, Ubuntu 25, and Arch currently use the X11 path.
- `mobile` mode is allowed only on Debian 13, Ubuntu 26, and Fedora 43/44.
- When Anland is enabled, the workflow disables PulseAudio forwarding because the Anland app provides its own audio path.
- Fedora may require hardware access on some devices to avoid flicker or crashes.
- Ubuntu and Debian may lag or freeze if `noseccomp` is disabled or the kernel lacks `USER_NS`.
- The default password is `1234`; change it after importing the RootFS.
- Compatibility between the bundled prebuilt Wayland packages and upstream anland depends on the upstream state at build time.
